**courseproject.Rmd:** is the RMarkdown file which, when compiled, produces courseproject.html

**courseproject.html:** is the .html file which displays my submission. 

**auxiliary.R** is an R file which courseproject.Rmd invokes, when compiling. It contains helper functions/code that I didn't want to include in the .Rmd file. 

**foldscomparison.png** is a .png version of the graph generated by the code in courseproject.Rmd. I include it here as a .png because the code that generates the data it relies on takes a very long time to run (ca. 15 mins). Rather than re-generate this data every time the file compiles, I prefer to include an already-generated image. Nonetheless, you can generate the image using the code, if you prefer.
